# MolSSI Brand Guidelines

# FONTS
# To use the proper DIN fonts lualatex must be used
# The style file is set up to look down one directory for the fonts directory,
# so if you are changing the directory structure the style files path will need
# to be updated

# Boarder
# lualatex must be run twice for it to generate the poster boarder correctly.
