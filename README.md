# MolSSI Brand Guidelines

## Logos
The MolSSI brand consists of the main MolSSI logo, and several variations which are associated with different projects.

### Main MolSSI Logos
There are two MolSSI logos. The logo saying "MolSSI" should  be used for most MolSSI communications including websites, newsletters and presentations. The horizontal logo with the full name of the institute ("The Molecular Sciences Software Institute") is used as a for official MolSSI letterheads and business cards.

### Special MolSSI Logos

The MolSSI logo is modified for some special projects. The modification should be done to the "molecule" attached to the 'o' in MolSSI.
